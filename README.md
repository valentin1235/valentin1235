### ABOUT ME
I have been working as backend developer with typescript and nodejs for my one year career.  
Also I had a few project with Java for my OOP studying.  
Now I am into C and really enjoying to understand how my code actually operated at the hardware level.  
Currently, I spend most of my time to programize the problem I study and implements my thinking into code.
